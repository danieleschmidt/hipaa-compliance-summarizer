# Security Tests

This directory contains security testing for the HIPAA Compliance Summarizer.

## Test Categories

### 1. PHI Protection Tests
- PHI detection accuracy and completeness
- Redaction effectiveness validation
- Data leak prevention
- Encryption verification

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Tests
- Access control validation
- Role-based permission testing
- Session management security
- API authentication testing

### 3. Input Validation Tests
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- File upload security
- Configuration injection

### 4. Cryptographic Tests
- Encryption/decryption validation
- Key management testing
- Secure random generation
- Certificate validation

### 5. Network Security Tests
- TLS/SSL configuration
- API endpoint security
- Network isolation
- Communication encryption

## Security Test Framework

```python
# Example security test structure
class TestPHISecurity:
    def test_phi_detection_completeness(self):
        """Verify all PHI categories are detected"""
        
    def test_redaction_effectiveness(self):
        """Ensure redaction prevents PHI exposure"""
        
    def test_data_encryption_at_rest(self):
        """Validate data is encrypted when stored"""
        
    def test_secure_data_deletion(self):
        """Verify secure deletion of PHI"""
```

## Security Test Data

Security tests use:
- Known PHI patterns and edge cases
- Malicious input payloads
- Invalid authentication attempts
- Boundary condition testing
- Synthetic attack scenarios

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run all security tests
pytest tests/security/ -v

# Run specific security category
pytest tests/security/test_phi_protection.py -v

# Security scan with coverage
pytest tests/security/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run with security assertions
pytest tests/security/ --strict-security

# Generate security report
pytest tests/security/ --security-report=reports/security.html
```

## Security Assertions

Custom security assertions:
- `assert_no_phi_exposure()` - Verify no PHI in output
- `assert_encrypted_storage()` - Validate encryption
- `assert_secure_communication()` - Check TLS usage
- `assert_access_controlled()` - Verify authorization

## Compliance Testing

Security tests validate:
- HIPAA Technical Safeguards compliance
- SOC 2 security controls
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- Industry best practices

## Vulnerability Testing

Automated vulnerability scanning:
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Static code analysis
- Dynamic security testing
- Container security scanning

## Security Test Environment

Security testing requires:
- Isolated test environment
- Controlled network access
- Security tool integration
- Audit logging enabled

## Reporting & Monitoring

Security test results include:
- Vulnerability assessments
- Compliance validation
- Security control effectiveness
- Risk assessment outcomes

## Integration with CI/CD

Security tests in pipeline:
- Pre-commit security hooks
- Automated security scanning
- Security gate enforcement
- Continuous monitoring

## Incident Response Testing

Security tests also cover:
- Breach detection scenarios
- Incident response procedures
- Recovery testing
- Forensic data collection
