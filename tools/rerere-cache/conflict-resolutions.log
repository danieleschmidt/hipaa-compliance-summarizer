# Git Rerere Conflict Resolution Log

This file tracks automatic conflict resolutions for audit purposes.

Date: 2025-07-26
Initial setup - no conflicts resolved yet.

## Configuration Status
- Git rerere enabled: ✅ 
- Custom merge drivers: ✅
- .gitattributes configured: ✅
- Mergify configured: ✅
- Audit infrastructure: ✅

## Next Steps
1. Add GitHub Actions workflows manually (see DEVOPS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Install local Git hooks per developer
3. Test with actual merge conflicts

Future entries will be added when rerere automatically resolves conflicts.

## Expected Automatic Resolutions
- package-lock.json conflicts → use incoming version
- poetry.lock conflicts → use incoming version  
- *.md conflicts → line union merge
- Previously resolved conflicts → rerere replay
