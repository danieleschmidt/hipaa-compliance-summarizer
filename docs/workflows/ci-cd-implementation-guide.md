# CI/CD Implementation Guide for HIPAA Compliance Summarizer

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for implementing CI/CD workflows for healthcare applications with HIPAA compliance requirements.

## Prerequisites

### Repository Setup
1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require pull request reviews (minimum 2 reviewers)
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Restrict pushes to main branch
   - Require linear history

2. **Required Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Container Registry
   DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME
   DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
   
   # Code Coverage
   CODECOV_TOKEN
   
   # Deployment Keys
   STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY
   PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY
   
   # Security Scanning
   SONAR_TOKEN
   SNYK_TOKEN
   
   # Notifications
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```

3. **Repository Variables**
   ```bash
   STAGING_URL=https://staging.hipaa-summarizer.com
   PRODUCTION_URL=https://hipaa-summarizer.com
   MONITORING_DASHBOARD=https://grafana.hipaa-summarizer.com
   ```

## Workflow Architecture

### Primary Workflows

#### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
Triggered on: Pull requests, pushes to main/develop

**Stages:**
1. **Setup & Dependencies**
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Python environment
   - Install dependencies with pip-tools
   - Cache dependencies

2. **Code Quality**
   - Ruff linting and formatting
   - MyPy type checking
   - Pre-commit hooks validation
   - Documentation linting

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Bandit security analysis
   - Safety vulnerability scanning  
   - pip-audit dependency scanning
   - Semgrep static analysis
   - detect-secrets scanning

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with pytest
   - Integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Coverage reporting (minimum 80%)

5. **Build Verification**
   - Package building
   - Docker image construction
   - Container security scanning with Trivy
   - SBOM generation

#### 2. Security & Compliance (`security.yml`)
Triggered on: Schedule (daily), security events

**Features:**
- SLSA Level 3 provenance generation
- Container image signing with Cosign
- License compliance checking
- Dependency update automation
- Vulnerability assessment reporting

#### 3. Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)
Triggered on: Successful CI completion, manual dispatch

**Environments:**
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment on develop branch
- **Production**: Manual approval required for main branch

**Steps:**
1. Build and push container images
2. Deploy to target environment
3. Run smoke tests
4. Health check validation
5. Rollback on failure

#### Deployment Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI/CD Pipeline"]
    types: [completed]
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          # Deployment script for staging environment
          echo "Deploying to staging..."
      
      - name: Run smoke tests
        run: |
          # Basic functionality tests

    needs: [deploy-staging]
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment script for production environment
          echo "Deploying to production..."
      
      - name: Verify deployment
        run: |
          # Comprehensive health checks
          curl -f ${{ vars.PRODUCTION_URL }}/health
```

## HIPAA Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection in CI/CD
1. **No PHI in Build Artifacts**
   - All test data must be synthetic
   - Scan for potential PHI exposure
   - Secure artifact storage

2. **Audit Trail Requirements**
   - Log all deployment activities
   - Track access to production systems
   - Maintain compliance documentation

3. **Access Controls**
   - Use environment protection rules
   - Require approval for production deployments
   - Implement role-based access

### Security Best Practices

#### Secrets Management
```yaml
# Never expose secrets in logs
- name: Deploy with secrets
  env:
    DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_PASSWORD }}
  run: |
    # Use secrets securely without logging
    deploy.sh
```

#### Container Security
```yaml
# Scan containers for vulnerabilities
- name: Container security scan
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
    format: sarif
    output: trivy-results.sarif
```

#### Dependency Management
```yaml
# Automated dependency updates
- name: Update dependencies
  uses: dependabot/dependabot-core@v1
  with:
    package-manager: pip
    directory: /
    schedule: weekly
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Workflow Monitoring
1. **Success/Failure Tracking**
   - Monitor build success rates
   - Track deployment frequency
   - Alert on consecutive failures

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Build duration tracking
   - Test execution time
   - Deployment success rate

3. **Security Alerts**
   - Vulnerability detection
   - Failed security scans
   - Unauthorized access attempts

### Notification Configuration
```yaml
# Slack notification on failure
- name: Notify on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    text: "CI/CD Pipeline failed for ${{ github.repository }}"
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback
```yaml
# Automatic rollback on health check failure
- name: Health check
  id: health_check
  run: |
    if ! curl -f ${{ vars.PRODUCTION_URL }}/health; then
      echo "Health check failed"
      exit 1
    fi

- name: Rollback on failure
  if: failure() && steps.health_check.outcome == 'failure'
  run: |
    # Rollback to previous version
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/hipaa-summarizer
```

### Manual Rollback Process
1. Identify deployment version to rollback to
2. Execute rollback procedure
3. Verify system functionality
4. Update monitoring and documentation

## Compliance Documentation

### Required Documentation
1. **Change Management Records**
   - All deployments logged
   - Approval workflows documented
   - Risk assessments completed

2. **Security Validation**
   - Security scan results archived
   - Penetration test reports
   - Compliance verification

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Complete deployment history
   - Access logs maintained
   - Incident response records

### Reporting and Metrics
- Deployment frequency and success rate
- Security scan results trending
- Compliance metric tracking
- Performance impact analysis

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Failed Security Scans**
   - Review vulnerability reports
   - Update dependencies
   - Apply security patches

2. **Test Failures**
   - Check test environment setup
   - Verify test data integrity
   - Review recent code changes

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check environment connectivity
   - Verify deployment credentials
   - Review resource availability

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Critical Security Vulnerability**
   - Immediate deployment halt
   - Emergency patch deployment
   - Security team notification

2. **Production Outage**
   - Automatic rollback activation
   - Incident response team alert
   - Customer communication plan
