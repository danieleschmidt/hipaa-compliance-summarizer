# Advanced GitHub Workflows Documentation

This directory contains documentation for advanced GitHub workflows that enhance the SDLC for the HIPAA Compliance Summarizer. These workflows require the `workflows` permission to be implemented.

## Required Advanced Workflows

### 1. Performance Monitoring Workflow

**File**: `performance-monitoring.yml`  
**Purpose**: Automated performance benchmarking and regression detection

**Schedule**: Daily at 2 AM UTC  
**Triggers**: Manual dispatch with configurable thresholds

**Key Features**:
- Memory and CPU profiling with py-spy and memory-profiler
- Performance benchmark comparison with baseline
- Automated PR comments with performance data
- Healthcare-specific metrics tracking (PHI processing rates)
- Performance regression alerts with configurable thresholds

### 2. Security Hardening Workflow

**File**: `security-hardening.yml`  
**Purpose**: Advanced security scanning and supply chain protection

**Schedule**: Weekly on Monday at 6 AM UTC  
**Triggers**: Push to main, PR with security-relevant changes

**Key Features**:
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation with CycloneDX
- Multi-layered vulnerability scanning (pip-audit, safety, semgrep)
- Healthcare-specific security patterns for HIPAA compliance
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Supply chain risk assessment and monitoring

### 3. Automated Dependency Updates Workflow

**File**: `dependency-update.yml`  
**Purpose**: Automated dependency management with security focus

**Schedule**: Weekly on Monday at 4 AM UTC  
**Triggers**: Manual dispatch with update type selection

**Key Features**:
- Daily vulnerability scanning with security advisory generation
- Intelligent update classification (patch/minor/major)
- Healthcare package prioritization for critical security updates
- Automated PR creation with comprehensive testing
- Supply chain security monitoring and analysis

## Implementation Instructions

To implement these workflows, a repository administrator with `workflows` permission should:

1. **Create the workflow files** in `.github/workflows/` directory
2. **Configure repository secrets** as needed for integrations
3. **Set up branch protection rules** to require workflow completion
4. **Configure notification channels** for alerts and security advisories

## Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub's workflow permission restrictions, these advanced workflows must be manually created by repository administrators:

### Workflow Configuration Files Needed

1. **`.github/workflows/performance-monitoring.yml`** - Performance benchmarking automation
2. **`.github/workflows/security-hardening.yml`** - Advanced security scanning  
3. **`.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`** - Automated dependency management

### Repository Configuration

**Branch Protection Rules**:
- Require status checks for security workflows
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Require conversation resolution before merging

**Required Permissions**:
- `workflows: write` - To create/modify workflow files
- `security-events: write` - For security findings
- `contents: write` - For PR creation
- `pull-requests: write` - For PR management

### Integration Requirements

**External Tools**:
- Trivy for container scanning
- Semgrep for static analysis
- CycloneDX for SBOM generation
- py-spy for CPU profiling
- memory-profiler for memory analysis

**Monitoring Stack**:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboards and visualization
- AlertManager for notification routing

## Workflow Specifications

The complete workflow specifications are documented in the SDLC Enhancement Summary. Each workflow includes:

- Comprehensive job definitions with security scanning
- Healthcare-specific compliance validation
- Performance benchmarking with regression detection
- Automated PR creation and review processes
- Security advisory generation for vulnerabilities

## Compliance Integration

### HIPAA Requirements
- Audit logging for all workflow executions
- Secure handling of vulnerability data
- No PHI data in workflow outputs
- Access control validation

### SOC 2 Controls
- Principle of least privilege for permissions
- Continuous monitoring of workflow execution
- Regular audit of workflow configurations
- Multi-factor authentication for modifications
