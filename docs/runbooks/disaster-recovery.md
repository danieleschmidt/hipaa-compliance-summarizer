```

#### Phase 4: Validation and Failover (60-75 minutes)
```bash
# Validate restored data

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance During DR

1. **Data Handling**
   - All backup and recovery operations must maintain PHI encryption
   - Access logs must be maintained throughout recovery
   - No PHI should be exposed in recovery logs or communications

2. **Audit Requirements**
   - Complete audit trail of all recovery actions
   - Documentation of any PHI access during recovery
   - Timeline of system unavailability for compliance reporting

3. **Business Associate Agreements**
   - Ensure all DR vendors have signed BAAs
   - Notify covered entities of any DR activations
   - Maintain compliance during extended outages

### Clinical Impact Mitigation

1. **Priority Processing**
   - Emergency/urgent PHI processing gets priority
   - Clinical decision support systems maintained
   - Patient safety systems isolated from DR impact

2. **Communication Protocols**
   - Direct communication with clinical staff
   - Alternative workflows for critical processes
   - Clear escalation paths for patient safety issues
