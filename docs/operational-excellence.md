   ```python
   # Multi-layer caching for healthcare data
   - L1: Application memory cache (Redis)
   - L2: Database query cache (PostgreSQL)
   - L3: CDN cache for static content
   - L4: Browser cache for UI assets
   ```

2. **Database Optimization**
   ```sql
   -- Optimized queries for PHI processing
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_phi_processing_timestamp 
   ON phi_processing_log (created_at, document_type);
   
   -- Partitioning for large compliance tables
   CREATE TABLE compliance_logs_2024_01 PARTITION OF compliance_logs
   FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
   ```

3. **Connection Pooling**
   ```yaml
   # Database connection pool optimization
   database:
     pool_size: 20
     max_overflow: 30
     pool_recycle: 3600
     pool_pre_ping: true
   ```

#### Infrastructure Layer
1. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - Static asset caching
   - Geographic distribution
   - SSL termination
   - DDoS protection

2. **Load Balancing**
   ```nginx
   # Nginx load balancer configuration
   upstream hipaa_app {
       least_conn;
       server app1.internal:8000 weight=3;
       server app2.internal:8000 weight=3;
       server app3.internal:8000 weight=2;
       
       # Health checks
       health_check interval=5s passes=2 fails=3;
   }
   ```

3. **Auto-scaling Policies**
   ```yaml
   # Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
   apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
   kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: hipaa-app-vpa
   spec:
     targetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: hipaa-app
     updatePolicy:
       updateMode: "Auto"
     resourcePolicy:
       containerPolicies:
       - containerName: app
         maxAllowed:
           cpu: 2
           memory: 4Gi
         minAllowed:
           cpu: 100m

- **Apdex Score**: Application performance index
- **Error Rate**: 4xx and 5xx response rates
- **Saturation**: Resource utilization metrics
- **Latency Distribution**: P50, P95, P99 response times

#### Performance Testing
```python
# Continuous performance testing
def performance_regression_test():
    """
    Automated performance regression testing
    """
    baseline_metrics = load_baseline_metrics()
    current_metrics = run_performance_tests()
    
    for metric, baseline in baseline_metrics.items():
        current = current_metrics[metric]
        regression_threshold = baseline * 1.1  # 10% regression threshold
        
        if current > regression_threshold:
            raise PerformanceRegressionError(
                f"Performance regression in {metric}: "
                f"{current} > {regression_threshold}"
            )
```

## Cost Optimization

### Healthcare Cost Considerations

#### Regulatory Compliance Costs
- **Audit and Compliance**: 15-20% of infrastructure costs
- **Security Controls**: 25-30% of total operational costs
- **Data Retention**: Long-term storage for regulatory requirements
- **Disaster Recovery**: 40-50% additional infrastructure for DR

#### Cost Allocation Model
```yaml
# Cost center allocation
cost_centers:
  clinical_operations: 40%    # Direct patient care support
  compliance_reporting: 25%   # Regulatory compliance
  security_operations: 20%    # Security and privacy
  development: 10%            # Feature development
  administration: 5%          # Administrative overhead
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Right-sizing Resources
```python
# Automated right-sizing recommendations
def generate_rightsizing_recommendations():
    """
    Generate cost optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
    """
    resources = get_resource_utilization(days=30)
    recommendations = []
    
    for resource in resources:
        if resource.avg_cpu_utilization < 20:
            recommendations.append({
                'resource': resource.name,
                'action': 'downsize',
                'potential_savings': calculate_savings(resource, 'smaller'),
                'risk_level': 'low'
            })
        elif resource.avg_cpu_utilization > 80:
            recommendations.append({
                'resource': resource.name,
                'action': 'upsize',
                'cost_increase': calculate_cost_increase(resource, 'larger'),
                'risk_level': 'performance_impact'
            })
    
    return recommendations
```

#### Reserved Capacity Planning
- **Database Reserved Instances**: 1-year terms for stable workloads
- **Compute Reserved Capacity**: 3-year terms for baseline capacity
- **Storage Optimization**: Intelligent tiering for compliance data
- **Network Optimization**: Regional data locality to reduce transfer costs

#### Cost Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
# Cost monitoring alerts
cost_alerts:
  - name: monthly_budget_80_percent
    threshold: 80%
    period: monthly
    action: notify_finance_team
  
  - name: daily_spike_detection
    threshold: 150%
