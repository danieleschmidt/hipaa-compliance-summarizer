# HIPAA Compliance Summarizer - Project Roadmap

## Vision Statement
Provide healthcare organizations with a secure, efficient, and compliant tool for processing and summarizing PHI-containing documents while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance standards.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations need to process large volumes of documents containing Protected Health Information (PHI) for compliance reporting, audit trails, and operational insights while ensuring complete data security and regulatory compliance.

## Success Criteria
