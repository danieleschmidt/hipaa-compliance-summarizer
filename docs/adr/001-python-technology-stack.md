# ADR-001: Python Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-27

## Context
The HIPAA Compliance Summarizer requires a robust technology stack that can handle healthcare document processing, natural language processing for PHI detection, and maintain security compliance. We need to choose core technologies that provide:

- Strong NLP and machine learning capabilities
- Healthcare industry standard libraries
- Security-focused development tools
- Compliance with healthcare regulations
- Active community support and maintenance

## Decision
We will use Python 3.8+ as the primary programming language with the following core dependencies:

### Core Framework
- **Python 3.8+**: Industry standard for healthcare AI/ML applications
- **setuptools**: Modern Python packaging and distribution
- **PyYAML**: Configuration management for HIPAA compliance settings

### Testing Framework
- **pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework with healthcare industry adoption
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting for compliance validation
- **pytest-xdist**: Parallel test execution for performance

### Security Tools
- **bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **detect-secrets**: Prevention of secret leakage in code
- **cryptography**: Industry-standard encryption library
- **pip-audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Code Quality
- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality enforcement

## Alternatives Considered

### Programming Languages
1. **Java**: Strong enterprise support but slower development cycle for AI/ML
2. **Node.js**: Good for web APIs but limited healthcare NLP libraries
3. **Go**: Excellent performance but immature healthcare ecosystem
4. **C#**: Microsoft ecosystem lock-in concerns

### Testing Frameworks
1. **unittest**: Python standard library but less feature-rich
2. **nose**: Deprecated and no longer maintained
3. **Robot Framework**: Good for integration testing but overkill for unit tests

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Healthcare Industry Standard**: Python is widely adopted in healthcare AI/ML
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries for NLP, security, and compliance
- **Security Focus**: Tools like bandit and detect-secrets provide healthcare-grade security
- **Performance**: Modern tools like ruff provide fast development cycles
- **Community Support**: Large, active community with healthcare focus

### Negative
- **Runtime Performance**: Python is slower than compiled languages for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Dependency Management**: Complex dependency trees can introduce security vulnerabilities
- **GIL Limitations**: Global Interpreter Lock can limit multi-threading performance

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use pytest-xdist for parallel test execution to overcome GIL limitations
- Regular dependency auditing with pip-audit to manage security risks
- Consider Cython or native extensions for performance-critical PHI detection algorithms
- Implement comprehensive monitoring to track performance characteristics

## Compliance Considerations
This technology stack aligns with healthcare industry standards and supports:
- HIPAA compliance through security-focused tooling
- SOC 2 Type II requirements via comprehensive testing and security scanning
- GDPR compliance through data protection libraries
- FDA regulations for healthcare software development
