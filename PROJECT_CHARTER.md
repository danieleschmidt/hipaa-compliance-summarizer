# PROJECT CHARTER: HIPAA Compliance Summarizer

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: HIPAA Compliance Summarizer  
**Project Sponsor**: Terragon Labs  
**Project Manager**: Autonomous Development Team  
**Charter Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Status**: Active Development  

## Problem Statement

Healthcare organizations process thousands of documents containing Protected Health Information (PHI) daily, but lack automated tools that can simultaneously:
- Identify and redact PHI with high accuracy
- Maintain clinical context for medical decision-making
- Generate compliance reports for HIPAA audits
- Scale to handle enterprise-level document volumes
- Provide real-time compliance monitoring

Manual PHI redaction is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates compliance risks that can result in significant penalties and patient privacy breaches.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core PHI Detection & Redaction**: Automated identification and redaction of 18 HIPAA-defined PHI categories
- **Healthcare Document Processing**: Support for clinical notes, lab reports, insurance forms, and administrative documents
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of audit-ready compliance reports
- **Batch Processing**: High-throughput processing for enterprise document volumes
- **Security Framework**: HIPAA-compliant security controls and audit logging
- **CLI and API Interfaces**: Command-line tools and programmatic interfaces
- **Integration Capabilities**: EHR system integration and workflow automation

### Out of Scope
- Real-time video/audio PHI detection
- Non-healthcare document types
- Custom EHR software development
- Legal compliance advice or consultation
- Third-party system customization beyond API integration

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **PHI Detection Accuracy**: ≥98% precision and recall for PHI identification
2. **Processing Performance**: Process clinical documents in <15 seconds average
3. **Compliance Score**: ≥95% overall HIPAA compliance rating
4. **False Positive Rate**: <2% false positive rate for PHI detection
5. **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime for production deployments

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **User Adoption**: Healthcare organizations using the system in production
2. **Documentation Quality**: Complete API documentation and user guides
3. **Test Coverage**: ≥90% code test coverage
4. **Security Certification**: SOC 2 Type II compliance verification
5. **Integration Success**: Working integrations with major EHR systems
