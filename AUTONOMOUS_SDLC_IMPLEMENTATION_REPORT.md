## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Input Validation System
```python
# File: src/hipaa_compliance_summarizer/validation.py
class InputValidator:
    - Malicious pattern detection
    - File type validation
    - Size limit enforcement
    - Risk scoring system
```

#### 2. Audit Logging System
```python
# File: src/hipaa_compliance_summarizer/audit_logger.py
class AuditLogger:
    - HIPAA-compliant event tracking
    - Structured JSON logging
    - Retention policy management
    - Privacy-preserving logs
```

#### 3. Performance Optimization Engine
```python
# File: src/hipaa_compliance_summarizer/performance_optimized.py
class PerformanceOptimizer:
    - Adaptive caching with memory pressure monitoring
    - Dynamic resource optimization
    - Intelligent batch processing
    - Performance metrics collection
```

#### 4. Auto-scaling System
```python
# File: src/hipaa_compliance_summarizer/auto_scaling.py
class AutoScaler:
    - CPU/memory-based scaling decisions
    - Worker pool management
    - Resource threshold monitoring
    - Graceful scaling transitions
```

### Dependency Management Strategy

The system implements intelligent fallback mechanisms for external dependencies:

- **PyYAML**: Falls back to basic configuration if unavailable
- **psutil**: Uses mock values for resource monitoring when missing
- **requests**: Provides degraded health check functionality

This approach ensures the system remains functional in constrained environments while providing enhanced features when dependencies are available.

### Configuration Architecture

#### 1. Hierarchical Configuration System
```python
# File: src/hipaa_compliance_summarizer/constants.py
- Environment variables (highest priority)
- Configuration files (YAML)
- Default values (fallback)
```

#### 2. Modular PHI Pattern Management
```python
# File: src/hipaa_compliance_summarizer/phi_patterns.py
- Category-based pattern organization
- Runtime pattern compilation
- Cache-optimized pattern matching
- Custom pattern support
```
