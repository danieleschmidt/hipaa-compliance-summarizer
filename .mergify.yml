          ðŸ¤– This PR has conflicts that may be auto-resolvable.
          
          The following strategies will be attempted:
          - Lock files: prefer incoming version
          - Documentation: line union merge
          - Rerere: apply previously resolved conflicts
          
          If conflicts remain after auto-resolution, manual intervention will be required.
