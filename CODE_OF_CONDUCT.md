# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security, especially when handling healthcare information
* Following HIPAA compliance guidelines and protecting PHI (Protected Health Information) at all times

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Sharing, discussing, or exposing actual PHI or healthcare data outside of authorized test environments
* Attempting to access, process, or store real patient data without proper authorization
* Bypassing or disabling security controls designed to protect healthcare information
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Healthcare Data Protection Responsibilities

Given the healthcare focus of this project, contributors have additional responsibilities:

### Data Handling
* Never use real patient data for development, testing, or demonstration purposes
* Use only synthetic, de-identified, or properly anonymized test data
* Report any suspected exposure of real PHI immediately to project maintainers
* Follow all applicable healthcare data protection regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

### Security Practices
* Implement secure coding practices to protect healthcare information
* Report security vulnerabilities through proper channels
* Never commit sensitive configuration, keys, or credentials to the repository
* Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing systems or data

### Compliance Awareness
* Stay informed about healthcare compliance requirements relevant to the project
* Ensure contributions maintain or improve the project's compliance posture
* Document compliance considerations in code reviews and discussions

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct has additional scope for healthcare data protection, applying to:
* All development environments and systems
* Test data creation and management
* Documentation and examples
* Integration with external healthcare systems
* Demonstration and training materials

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [conduct@hipaa-summarizer.com](mailto:conduct@hipaa-summarizer.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

For healthcare data protection violations or security concerns, report immediately to:
* **Security Team**: [security@hipaa-summarizer.com](mailto:security@hipaa-summarizer.com)
* **Compliance Team**: [compliance@hipaa-summarizer.com](mailto:compliance@hipaa-summarizer.com)

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
