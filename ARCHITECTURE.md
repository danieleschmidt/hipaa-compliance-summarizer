# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The HIPAA Compliance Summarizer is a healthcare-focused document processing system that automatically detects, redacts, and summarizes Protected Health Information (PHI) while maintaining HIPAA compliance standards.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **Input Handler**: Supports multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, HL7 FHIR)
- **PHI Scanner**: Uses NLP models to identify protected health information
- **Redaction Engine**: Applies configurable redaction strategies
- **Output Generator**: Creates compliant summaries and reports

### 2. Configuration Management
- **HIPAA Config**: Centralized compliance settings (`config/hipaa_config.yml`)
- **Pattern Management**: Customizable PHI detection patterns
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for multiple deployment environments

### 3. CLI Interface
- **hipaa-summarize**: Single document processing
- **hipaa-batch-process**: Bulk document processing
- **hipaa-compliance-report**: Compliance reporting and analytics

### 4. Security & Compliance
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and audit trails
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Real-time HIPAA violation detection

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**
   - Document ingestion and validation (PDF, TXT, DOCX, HL7 FHIR)
   - Format detection and conversion using parsers
   - Initial security scanning and virus detection
   - Metadata extraction and document classification

2. **PHI Analysis**
   - Pattern-based detection using enhanced regex patterns
   - ML model inference with BioBERT/ClinicalBERT
   - Confidence scoring for identified PHI entities (0.0-1.0)
   - Context-aware classification with clinical understanding
   - Cache-optimized pattern matching for performance

3. **Redaction Processing**
   - Configurable redaction strategies:
     - Complete removal for high-risk PHI
     - Masking with asterisks for moderate-risk data
     - Synthetic replacement with realistic alternatives
     - Tokenization for reversible access control
   - Clinical context preservation algorithms
   - Document structure maintenance with layout preservation

4. **Compliance Validation**
   - HIPAA Safe Harbor rule validation (18 identifier categories)
   - Risk assessment scoring based on PHI exposure
   - Compliance policy enforcement engine
   - Audit trail generation with timestamp tracking
   - Violation detection and alert system

5. **Output Generation**
   - Summary report creation with clinical context
   - Compliance metrics calculation and scoring
   - Redacted document generation with watermarks
   - Audit logs in structured JSON format
   - Secure storage with encryption at rest
