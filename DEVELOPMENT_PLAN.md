# ✅ Epic & Task Checklist

### 🔒 Increment 1: Security & Foundations
- [ ] [EPIC] Eliminate hardcoded secrets
  - [ ] Load from environment securely
  - [ ] Add pre-commit hook for scanning secrets
- [ ] [EPIC] Improve CI stability
  - [ ] Replace flaky integration tests
  - [ ] Enable parallel test execution

### 📈 Increment 2: Performance & Observability
- [ ] [EPIC] Optimize batch operations
  - [ ] Profile and remove I/O bottlenecks
  - [ ] Cache PHI patterns for reuse
- [ ] [EPIC] Add structured logging
  - [ ] Include compliance score metrics
  - [ ] Emit processing time per document

### 🔧 Increment 3: Scalability & UX
- [ ] [EPIC] Modularize codebase
  - [ ] Split redaction, scoring, and reporting packages
  - [ ] Document public interfaces
- [ ] [EPIC] Publish v1 release
  - [ ] Prepare CHANGELOG entries
  - [ ] Push package to PyPI

# ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation
- Misconfigured PHI patterns could leak sensitive data → add unit tests and config validation
- CI pipeline may slow down with more tests → enable caching and parallel jobs
- Dependency updates might introduce breaking changes → use Dependabot and pin versions
- Users may misinterpret compliance scores → provide clear documentation and warnings

# 📊 KPIs & Metrics
- [ ] >85% test coverage
- [ ] <15 min CI pipeline time
- [ ] <5% error rate on core service
- [ ] 100% secrets loaded from vault/env

# 👥 Ownership & Roles (Optional)
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, secret management
- **Backend**: Batch processing, API design
- **QA**: Automated tests and coverage reporting
